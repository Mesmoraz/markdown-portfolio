I am a __dancer__, __game developer__, _past_ __teacher__, and certified __personal trainer__.
I create software that helps people think about themselves, their world and how they interact with other accordingly, through games.
Questions of values - what should be done? What are the consequences? What _is_ good? Notions such as these are of grave concern regarding the games I develop.
__My hope__ is that players will come from a game thinking about the world in a slightly different way.
