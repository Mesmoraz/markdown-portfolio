Hello, my name is Taylor. I stay healthy and strong by __lifitng weights, dancing and practicing yoga.__ 

I am a __Game Developer__ and .NET developer. _My goal_, as I see it, is to create experiences for people to see the world in slightly different ways. To expose values and
encourage people to learn and struggle with their own minds in order to accomplish something hard.
